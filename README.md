# NM_Music

This is my first ever application created with Swift on Xcode.

It starts with a list selection of nationality for singers. Then it transfers to singers page where one can select a singer and a list of tracks is displayed with usage of REST API.

I have worked with basic concepts of [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit "UIKit") here and utilized [URLSessions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession "URLSession"), formatted JSON data and used [Navigation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uinavigationcontroller "UINavigationController").

Pictures of application comming soon!
